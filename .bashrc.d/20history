## Do *not* append the following to our history: consecutive duplicate
## commands, ls, bg and fg, and exit
## Don't keep useless history commands. Note the last pattern is to not
## keep dangerous commands in the history file.  Who really needs to
## repeat the shutdown(8) command accidentally from your command
## history?
HISTIGNORE='\&:fg:bg:pwd:jobs:set -x'
HISTIGNORE=${HISTIGNORE}':%1:%2:popd:shutdown*'
export HISTIGNORE

## Save multi-line commands in history as single line
shopt -s cmdhist

## Disk is cheap. Memory is cheap. My memory isn't! Keep a lot of
## history by default. 10K lines seems to go back about 6 months, and
## captures all of the wacky one-off shell scripts that I might want
## again later.
export HISTSIZE=100000
export HISTFILESIZE=${HISTSIZE}

## Reduce redundancy in the history file - prevent bash from caching duplicate history entries
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups

## Do not delete your precious history file before writing the new one
shopt -s histappend

## This is useful for embedded newlines in commands and quoted arguments
shopt -s lithist
